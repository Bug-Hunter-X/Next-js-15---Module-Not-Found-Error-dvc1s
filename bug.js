```javascript
// pages/index.js
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>Hello world!</div>
  );
}
```

This code will result in an error if you try to import a module that uses a feature not supported in the environment where the code is being executed. For example, you might get an error if you try to import a module that uses the `fs` module (for file system access) in a browser environment, since browsers do not have access to the file system.
